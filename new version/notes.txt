To do:
1. get rid of arduino and switch to more efficient/sutible controller (maybe ATtiny1634 - may run in idle mode)
2. switch to c code and make/use custom functions for ease of programming/modification
3. add fault/error detection 
4. design smaller pcb after aurduino is removed 
5. get rid of pin 6(jumper 4) b/c it isnt connected to anything (floating)
6. get rid of A4(SB) b/c it isnt connected to anything(no SB on pot.)
7. get rid of pin 7(BL:back light) b/c its always low and we can attach it to switch
8. add logic buffers to protect controller
9. add isp program circuit
10. Either switch 100nF(.1uF) caps to 0603 package or switch pads to fit 1206
11. Check dimensions of 3.5mm aux jack package 


What is being used/needed by circuit:
1. 1 X PWM for power/heat control of Iron
2. 1 x ADC for temp. in from Iron

3. 1 x ADC for analog in of potentiometer for setting temp.

4. 1 x SPI for display communication
5. 2 x gpio for DC(data/command) and CS(chip select)
6. 1 x Jtag
